changes to remote.js:
before, remote.js assumed that the url to hit on the server was "index.php", it
still is now, but it can now be configured with the furnisher variable at the
top of the file

changed the setCss function to create the css link elements with
document.createElement, instead of using what the JSON-ML decoding function
produces, this seemed to be necessary to get IE to recognise the link node

changes to remote_form.js:
replaced uploaded form url from /ext/upload.php with a variable at the top of
the file
